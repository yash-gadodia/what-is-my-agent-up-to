## 0) Judge Criteria (from briefing)

1. Clarity of idea
2. Technical execution
3. Completeness
4. Impact and insight
5. Use of Codex

## 1) Core Pitch (Say This Early)

WIMUT is a live observability dashboard for Codex runs. In under 5 seconds, it tells you what the agent is doing now, whether progress is healthy, and what intervention to take if it is stuck.

## 2) 2-Minute Video Script (Say + Show + Proves)

### 0:00-0:15 Problem + Value

- Say: "Agent runs are powerful but hard to read live. We built WIMUT so operators can understand runtime state and intervene confidently."
- Show: Dashboard landing with active lanes and top summary bar.
- Proves: Clarity of idea.

### 0:15-0:35 Live Codex Ingestion

- Say: "This is not a mock feed. We ingest real Codex app-server notifications through our relay."
- Show: Connected status + live lane updates while relay is running.
- Proves: Use of Codex, technical execution.

### 0:35-0:55 Traceability (Raw -> Derived)

- Say: "Every visual change is traceable. Here is the raw event, and here is the derived operational meaning."
- Show: Open one timeline event and inspect raw payload + mapped meaning side by side.
- Proves: Technical execution, runtime traceability.

### 0:55-1:20 Operator Insight

- Say: "We do not just display telemetry. We compute stuck risk and propose the next operator action."
- Show: Scorecard, stuck signal, and intervention text for one agent/run.
- Proves: Impact and insight.

### 1:20-1:40 Completeness + Reliability

- Say: "The full workflow is covered: live mode, inspector, scorecard, replay, and simulator fallback for deterministic demos."
- Show: Quick switch to replay or simulator controls in Ops drawer, then back.
- Proves: Completeness and demo reliability.

### 1:40-2:00 Close

- Say: "WIMUT turns agent activity into operational clarity: faster understanding, safer interventions, and higher trust in Codex-driven workflows."
- Show: Return to live view with multiple active lanes and status chips.
- Proves: Clarity, impact, and use of Codex.

## 3) Criteria Coverage Checklist (Before Recording)

1. Clarity of idea: one-sentence problem/value stated in first 15s.
2. Technical execution: relay/app-server path mentioned and visible.
3. Completeness: live + inspector + scorecard + replay/simulator touched.
4. Impact and insight: stuck score and intervention recommendation shown.
5. Use of Codex: explicitly state source is Codex app-server events.

## 4) 2-Minute Talking Points Cheat Sheet

### Product Points To Cover

- Problem: live agent runs are hard to parse quickly under pressure.
- User value: gives instant answer to "what is happening now?"
- Decision support: highlights stuck risk and suggests intervention.
- Trust: raw event inspector keeps the system explainable.
- Reliability: replay/simulator keeps demo flow stable if live stream degrades.

### Technical Points To Cover

- Ingestion path: Codex app-server notifications relayed over websocket.
- Protocol rigor: initialize -> thread/start -> turn/start lifecycle.
- Mapping layer: raw events normalized into stable derived signals.
- Runtime signals: tool activity, file changes, errors/success, stuck score.
- Fallback architecture: live + replay + simulator + swarm for resilience.

## 5) Criteria Mapping Talking Points

### 4.1 Clarity of idea

- The city/lane view answers "what is happening now" at a glance.
- Story and score surfaces reduce interpretation time during live runs.

### 4.2 Technical execution

- Relay harness uses Codex app-server protocol path (initialize -> thread/start -> turn/start).
- Frontend keeps raw-event visibility and explicit derived mapping logic.

### 4.3 Completeness

- Live mode, replay path, simulator fallback, timeline, inspector, and intervention scorecard are all available.
- Swarm mode supports multi-agent stress scenarios for local reliability checks.

### 4.4 Impact and insight

- Stuck scoring identifies unhealthy loops/inactivity.
- Intervention text converts telemetry into concrete operator action.

### 4.5 Use of Codex

- Primary source is live Codex app-server notifications, not synthetic-only events.
- Raw payload remains inspectable to preserve trust and debugging value.

## 6) Runtime Readiness Snapshot

- Branch: main
- Commit: 1eb0eb4
- Working tree changed files: 12
- Node: v24.10.0
- npm: 11.6.0
- Test status from this refresh: not run (use --verify for strict pre-judge refresh)

- Live relay script present: yes
- Swarm fallback script present: yes
- Helper script present: yes
- Replay mentioned in runtime docs: yes
- Simulator mentioned in runtime docs: yes
- Raw inspector path mentioned: yes
- Scorecard path mentioned: yes
- Stuck detection path mentioned: yes

## 7) Judge Questions You Should Pre-Answer

1. Why does this need to exist if logs already exist?
- Logs show data, WIMUT shows operational state + intervention path in real time.

2. How do you avoid being "just another dashboard"?
- We keep traceability from raw Codex events to derived insights and prioritize operator decisions over vanity charts.

3. What happens if live ingestion fails during demo?
- We fail fast visibly, then switch to replay/simulator for deterministic narrative continuity.

4. What is technically hard here?
- Stable event normalization under noisy runtime streams while preserving raw inspectability.

5. What is the measurable impact?
- Lower time-to-understand and faster intervention when runs stall, error, or require approval.

## 8) Final 10-Minute Pre-Judging Checklist

1. Run: `npm run pitch:prep:verify`
2. Start UI: `npm run dev`
3. Start relay: `npm run relay -- --repo /abs/path --prompt "Run tests and fix first failure"`
4. Optional helper: `npm run helper`
5. Open UI and validate: websocket connected, timeline events flowing, scorecard changing
6. Keep swarm fallback command ready: `npm run swarm -- --repo /abs/path --count 4 --port 8899 --continuous true`
7. Rehearse one clean sentence per judging criterion

## 9) Red-Flag Avoidance (During Pitch)

- Do not start with simulator if live is healthy; show Codex path first.
- Do not hide raw events; inspectors increase trust with judges.
- Do not over-focus visuals; always tie back to intervention decisions.
- If stream noise rises, explicitly narrate fallback switch instead of silently changing modes.
