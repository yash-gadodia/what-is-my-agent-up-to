This file is generated by `scripts/update-pitch-prep.mjs`.
Regenerate with:

`npm run pitch:prep`

Continuous auto-refresh (every 30s default):

`npm run pitch:prep:watch`

Strict pre-judge refresh (runs tests too):

`npm run pitch:prep:verify`

## 0) Judge Criteria (from briefing)

1. Clarity of idea
2. Technical execution
3. Completeness
4. Impact and insight
5. Use of Codex

## 1) One-Line Pitch

WIMUT is a live observability dashboard for Codex runs that makes agent behavior legible in seconds and gives operators clear intervention decisions.

## 2) 2-Minute Demo Script

1. Open the dashboard and state the problem in one sentence: agent runs are noisy and hard to intervene in confidently.
2. Show live connection status + run lanes to establish this is runtime, not a static mock.
3. Trigger/observe activity and explain mapping from raw events to derived signals (tool activity, file changes, error/success).
4. Open one timeline item and compare raw payload vs derived meaning to prove traceability.
5. Show scorecard + stuck signal and read intervention suggestion out loud.
6. Switch to replay/simulator only if live stream gets noisy, while preserving the same operational narrative.
7. Close with impact: faster understanding, safer intervention, more trustworthy agent operations.

## 3) Criteria Mapping Talking Points

### 3.1 Clarity of idea

- The city/lane view answers "what is happening now" at a glance.
- Story and score surfaces reduce interpretation time during live runs.

### 3.2 Technical execution

- Relay harness uses Codex app-server protocol path (initialize -> thread/start -> turn/start).
- Frontend keeps raw-event visibility and explicit derived mapping logic.

### 3.3 Completeness

- Live mode, replay path, simulator fallback, timeline, inspector, and intervention scorecard are all available.
- Swarm mode supports multi-agent stress scenarios for local reliability checks.

### 3.4 Impact and insight

- Stuck scoring identifies unhealthy loops/inactivity.
- Intervention text converts telemetry into concrete operator action.

### 3.5 Use of Codex

- Primary source is live Codex app-server notifications, not synthetic-only events.
- Raw payload remains inspectable to preserve trust and debugging value.

## 4) Runtime Readiness Snapshot

- Branch: main
- Commit: 73db780
- Working tree changed files: 3
- Node: v24.10.0
- npm: 11.6.0
- Test status from this refresh: not run (use --verify for strict pre-judge refresh)

- Live relay script present: yes
- Swarm fallback script present: yes
- Helper script present: yes
- Replay mentioned in runtime docs: yes
- Simulator mentioned in runtime docs: yes
- Raw inspector path mentioned: yes
- Scorecard path mentioned: yes
- Stuck detection path mentioned: yes

## 5) Judge Questions You Should Pre-Answer

1. Why does this need to exist if logs already exist?
- Logs show data, WIMUT shows operational state + intervention path in real time.

2. How do you avoid being "just another dashboard"?
- We keep traceability from raw Codex events to derived insights and prioritize operator decisions over vanity charts.

3. What happens if live ingestion fails during demo?
- We fail fast visibly, then switch to replay/simulator for deterministic narrative continuity.

4. What is technically hard here?
- Stable event normalization under noisy runtime streams while preserving raw inspectability.

5. What is the measurable impact?
- Lower time-to-understand and faster intervention when runs stall, error, or require approval.

## 6) Final 10-Minute Pre-Judging Checklist

1. Run: `npm run pitch:prep:verify`
2. Start UI: `npm run dev`
3. Start relay: `npm run relay -- --repo /abs/path --prompt "Run tests and fix first failure"`
4. Optional helper: `npm run helper`
5. Open UI and validate: websocket connected, timeline events flowing, scorecard changing
6. Keep swarm fallback command ready: `npm run swarm -- --repo /abs/path --count 4 --port 8899 --continuous true`
7. Rehearse one clean sentence per judging criterion

## 7) Red-Flag Avoidance (During Pitch)

- Do not start with simulator if live is healthy; show Codex path first.
- Do not hide raw events; inspectors increase trust with judges.
- Do not over-focus visuals; always tie back to intervention decisions.
- If stream noise rises, explicitly narrate fallback switch instead of silently changing modes.
